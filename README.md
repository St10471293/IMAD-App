# Project analyses/details:
My “Mpho’s Kitchen” App is a mobile application produced and developed for the Introduction to Mobile Application assignment (IMAD). The app's Primary objective is to generate various meal options for the user based on the time of the user’s choice e.g. (Morning-Breakfast meal option). The mobile application is created using both Android Studio and Kotlin.

My Mobile application was created according to the specifications and requirements of the assignment, requirements being that GitHub is used for version control and CI/CD automation through GitHub Actions, as well as a successful creation of a fully functional App.


# Features and Objectives of the App

App Objective:
The main Objective of this mobile app is to assist the user in generating a variety of meal options according but not limited to the time of day it is under the categories of “Morning snack, Breakfast , Lunch , Dinner and Late-night snack” 



Key Features:
- the application generates a variety of food options depending on the input the user submits.
-the app does not provide a meal option if there is a spelling mistake on the user’s input.
- the app is easy to use and because of that it is beneficial to download.

# Design Elements
The design of the app was based on:

1. User Experience: The mobile app is designed with the objective to provide an easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring an unseamed user interaction.
   
2. Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well in terms of device compatibility on different screen.
   
3. Simplicity: The design is modest, focusing on specific features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. Performance: Code maximisation and optimization was bear in mind to Guarantee fast response times as well as low battery usage.


# GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization

This mobile application was managed using GitHub for version control, where majority code changes are pushed regularly. GitHub allowed me to keep track of possible changes as well as maintain project validity.

#Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the course of the development of the app, I experienced a few challenges, being the following:

1st Challenge: figuring out what logical error I could have had that resulted in my app crashing when attempting to run it the first few times.
Solution – I brought it up to my lecturer and a solution was produced.
   
2nd Challenge: I could not push my link on to GitHub.
Solution – I communicated with my lecturer.

#Future Improvements

Even though the current version of the application provides the core objective, there are many improvements that can be included in the future, including:

Improvement 1: Allowing users to access app history to keep track of the consumption of food.
Improvement 2:  Provide more screens to the app to increase usage.
Improvement 3: Improve The Search Feature of my App Design


Why:
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
